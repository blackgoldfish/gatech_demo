## Chest X-ray image analysis with DCNN: disease classification and localization
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/P_7IeELltR0   <br /> 
•	Incorporate the VGG/DenseNet base-model and the additional transitional/pooling/prediction layers to build the DCNN architecture to do multi-label classification and heatmap disease localization within 108,948 ChestXray images by Keras/python on AWS and Azure.<br/>
•	Achieves AUC up to 0.83. Disease localization gains an accuracy up to 0.6096. <br/>

## Data visualization analytics project: Interactive Map Exploration of the Gerrymandering Effects on Districts
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/cbvEByuvdQo     <br /> 
•	Big data (10GB) preprocessing by python and storage by SQLite. Interactive visualization by Tableau.
## Software design and programming project: Cryptogram Game App in Android 
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/hC7GFnZbn1c     <br /> 
•	Developed an app for multi user to play cryptogram game. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram) <br/>
•	Performed architecture design, generated use case model, programmed through android studio and tested the functionality through test cases.<br/>  
## Database system design and management project: GTBay website
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/W6Drf6aNdtI     <br /> 
•	Created the SQL schemas and SQL queries to insert, update, select, delete and sort data.<br/>
•	Built the user interface and enabled it to communicate with the database by Postgre SQL and Java.<br/>
•	Successfully set up the GTBay website which allowed users to sell, bid and buy items like Ebay.<br/>
## Reinforcement Learning project: landing lunar lander rocket with dueling double DQN and prioritized experience replay
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/GqfS-xyuc6w  <br /> 
•	Programmed a space vehicle Lunar Lander to learn to land within a safe zone from a starting point without crashing in OpenAI's gym environment with the Deep Q Networking algorithm in Python. <br/>
•	By optimizing hyper parameters and improving the algorithm with Prioritized Experience Replay, the converged rewards are consistent within 100 trials and higher than the targeted goal value.
