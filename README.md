## Chest X-ray image analysis with DCNN: disease classification and localization
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/P_7IeELltR0   <br /> 
Highlight: Achieves AUC up to 0.83 with DCNN. Disease localization shows promising results with an accuracy up to 0.6096.
## Data visuallization analytics project: Interactive Map Exploration of the Gerrymandering Effects on Districts
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/cbvEByuvdQo     <br /> 
Highlight: Big data (10GB) preprocessing by python and storage by SQLite. Interactive visuallization by Tableau. 
## Software design and programming project: Cryptogram Game App in Android 
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/hC7GFnZbn1c     <br /> 
Highlight: an app developed by android studio for multi user to play cryptogram game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram). 
## Database system design and management project: GTBay website
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/W6Drf6aNdtI     <br /> 
Highlight: GTBay website (similar to ebay) website created by ProgreSQL and java 
## Reinforcement Learning project: landing lunar lander rocket with dueling double DQN and prioritized experience replay
youtube link of the demo: https://youtu.be/GqfS-xyuc6w  <br /> 
•	Programmed a space vehicle Lunar Lander to learn to land within a safe zone from a starting point without crashing in OpenAI's gym environment with the Deep Q Networking algorithm in Python. <br/>
•	By optimizing hyper parameters and improving the algorithm with Prioritized Experience Replay, the converged rewards are consistent within 100 trials and higher than the targeted goal value.
